# Core Java Programs

This repository contains Core Java programs that I have written to build a strong foundation in Java programming and problem-solving. The programs cover fundamental Java concepts as well as algorithmic techniques.

## Topics Covered

* Type Conversion and Type Casting
* Advanced Pattern Problems
* Searching Algorithms
* Sorting Algorithms
* Bit Manipulation
* String Handling
* 2D Arrays
* Object-Oriented Programming and Methodology (OOPM)

## Program Details

### Type Conversion and Type Casting

Programs demonstrating implicit and explicit type conversion between different data types to understand data compatibility and precision handling in Java.

### Advanced Pattern Problems

Pattern printing programs using nested loops and conditional logic to improve logical thinking and loop control.

### Searching Algorithms

Implementation of common searching techniques such as:

* Linear Search
* Binary Search

These programs demonstrate efficient searching techniques and basic time complexity concepts.

### Sorting Algorithms

Implementation of popular sorting algorithms, including:

* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Counting Sort

These programs help in understanding comparisons, swapping, and algorithm efficiency.

### Bit Manipulation

Programs using bitwise operators to perform operations such as checking, setting, and toggling bits, and solving basic binary problems.

### String Programs

Programs related to string manipulation such as reversing strings, palindrome checking, character counting, and usage of built-in String methods.

### 2D Array Programs

Programs working with two-dimensional arrays including matrix traversal and basic matrix operations.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOPM)

Programs demonstrating core OOP concepts such as:

* Classes and Objects
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Abstraction

## Objective

The objective of this repository is to strengthen Core Java fundamentals, improve problem-solving skills, and gain hands-on experience with Java programming concepts.
